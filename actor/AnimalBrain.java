/**
 * A AnimalBrain is the 'brain' for an Animal in the game of SJAAnimal.  Each time that 
 an Animal is given its turn to act, it asks its AnimalBrain how it should act.  The
 Animal also provides the AnimalBrain with all of the sensor information it has.  
 </br>
 It is important to note that even though a AnimalBrain has a Location, 
 changing that location does not actually move the Animal (or the AnimalBrain.)  
 It is only changing where you think you are, but really you're only fooling 
 yourself.  The same is true about the other parameters a AnimalBrain has.  
 </br>
 * While this structure is intended to keep you from 'cheating' the game.  
 * I'm sure some of you will find a way around it.  Therefore, it is a rule 
 * that any attempts to work around the rules will eliminate you from all 
 * competitions.  (Although I would like to get feedback so that I can 
 * improve how the game works.)
